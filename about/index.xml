      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am one of the lucky guys who love their field of work.&lt;br&gt;
I can really work at 100% alone or in a team. My experience in the industry allows me to understand quickly what is that the stakeholders need and how it will be become “alive” using the best practices and trends. It helps me also to collaborate with my colleagues and at critical work situations to lead the team out of any problem. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A little bit “nerd” as even in my free time i love to create my own projects and try to learn as much as i can about my work field. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am open-minded in my work for practices and collaborations and also in my life, loving to meet new people and to work in multicultural environments. &lt;br&gt;
I call Europe “My Country” but truly i feel like a world citizen. I love traveling and listening good (by my taste) music.&lt;/p&gt;
